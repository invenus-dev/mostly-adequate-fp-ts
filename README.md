# mostly-adequate-fp-ts tryout

Trivia:
- I have found a great fp resource in this gitbook: https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/
- I wondered how it would map to fp-ts
- Then I found this resource: https://cjonas.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-fp-ts/
- But it still lacks the actual full code
- Hence I just went through all chapters of the original Mostly Adequate and applied everything into "containers", one for each chapter. 
I ommited chapters without any relevant code making sense to implement.

## Usage

- `yarn` to install all deps
- `yarn start` - opens your browser on localhost:8080. Use browser console to actually trace output.
